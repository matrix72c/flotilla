# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before 1.0, minor versions may contain breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Task-level `network_mode = "no-network"` and `allow_internet = false`, preserving service links while removing external access throughout preparation and execution.
- Explicit cluster DNS declarations: offline policies tolerate only the declared resolver IPs on TCP/UDP 53 and reject every other implicit egress exception.
- Opt-in sandbox ingress enforcement using the shared OpenSandbox lifecycle route. Compose `network_mode: none` now checks both outbound exceptions and inbound isolation; upstream requests retain the standard egress-only schema by default.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-20

Initial public release plus downstream orchestration contracts.

### Added

- Async Python API (`Flotilla`, `open_task`, `open_environment`, `environment`) for running a Compose task as one sandbox per service, with confirmed cleanup reports.
- Command execution with explicit argv, identity, and environment; background processes; binary file and directory transfers.
- Cancellation and timeout semantics that never replay commands and report unknown outcomes as `ExecOutcomeUnknown`.
- Automatic image preparation with Docker BuildKit, including digest resolution, mirroring, and derived images.
- Explicit network policies (`none`, allowlist, `any`) with CIDR or sandbox-ID peer links.
- OpenSandbox backend supporting the `current` and `legacy` execd protocols.
- CLI: `inspect`, `probe`, `gc`, and `share publish|verify|gc`.
- Optional Harbor 0.24.0 environment adapter (`flotilla.integrations.harbor:FlotillaEnvironment`).

- Environment-specific inspection and public resource reservations, including per-client anchor overhead.
- Process waits with bounded observation timeouts, and explicit stop with confirmed termination.
- Public `flotilla.testing` helpers for downstream contract tests, separate from runtime imports.
